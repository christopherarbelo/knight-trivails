# Knight Trivails

## Objective
This project uses a custom data structure similar to a binary tree and utilizes breath first search to find the shortest path to get to another place on a chess board using a knight chess piece.

In ```lib/main.rb``` you can call the shortest_path method on the Knight object and put your origin coordinates and destination coordinates (from an 8x8 board) and an array of coordinates with the shortest path will be presented.
